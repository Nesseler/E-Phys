README-analyze_cccnt_rest

current clamp protocol
t = 10 min
I_hold = 0 pA

This script is written to analyze all aspects that can be extracted from this protocol. See the description of the parameters in this file.

Data will be saved to...
  trace_df - qdata/cnt_rest/traces
  spikes_df - qdata/cnt_rest/spikes
  ISIs_df - qdata/cnt_rest/ISIs
  bursts_df - qdata/cnt_rest/bursts
  cnt_rest_values - qdata/cell_descriptors

trace_df
  v - Original recorded voltage trace
  vf - 1 kHz bessel-filtered voltage trace
  i - Reconstructed current trace (from parameters)
  t_ms - Time in milliseconds.
  t_s - Time in seconds.
  dvdt - First derivative of filtered voltage trace in millivolt/milliseconds.

  SR - Sampling rate in Hz (written in the first row only)
  SR_ms - Sampling rate in mHz (written in the first row only)

... when saved, will be saved to csv to circumvent excel size restrictions.
